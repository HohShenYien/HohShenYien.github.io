## What inspired me to program?

It all started with this amazing website [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
There were many interesting math-programming problems in this website that I wanted to
try solving. Therefore, I started learning Python from another wonderful app, 
[sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/).

At start, I didn't have a personal laptop, so all I had was a phone and pydroid app
as my python editor in phone. Thus, it's possible for everyone to learn programming
because even I who only started with a simple phone could learn programming.

## How did I move on?

Then, I just became more and more interested with programming and coding. I began to
solve more problems from Project Euler and eventually came across another intriguing
website, [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). From this website, I was exposed with the
concepts of Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA).

To be able to learn more about DSA, I started to watch [Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/) from [MIT Opencourseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/). Though I couldn't complete the entire course (I was quite a beginner back then),
I've become more experienced in coding and this helped building my
fundamentals for programming.

Thereafter, I coded more and more, and learned sseveral other programming languages along the way until I am who I am today.
