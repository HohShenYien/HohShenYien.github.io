I was having my year 1 final exam on 16 to 23 July. It took me another week to prepare some teaching 
materials for my tutoring session. Now that I have some free time, I thought I'd share my experience
in Asia Pacific University's Computer Science Degree Year 1.

I took 5 core subjects in each semester excluding the Malaysian compulsory subjects.

## Semester 1

As the first semester in university, the subjects were mostly introductory.

- ### Python Programming

    This subject was mainly about pseudocodes, flowcharts and basic programming concepts
    like loops, conditions and functions through Python. The final assignment for this
    subject was writing a sports management system in Python (text-based program of course).

    However, as I had programming experience prior to taking this subject, I did not
    learn anything new, nor was the assignment challenging to me. Moreover, the use
    of pseudocodes and flowcharts in teaching programming seemed pointless and redundant to me.
    Not to mention pseudocodes and flowcharts were a big part of the assignment! Lastly, instead
    of any good editors or IDE, Python IDLE was used instead to conduct the lessons and 
    for demonstrating the assignment which gave me a bad experience.

- ### Introduction to Management

    This subject was regarding some business and management principles. The textbook used was [Management](https://www.pearson.com/uk/educators/higher-education-educators/program/Robbins-Management-Global-Edition-14th-Edition/PGM1846230.html) 
    from [Pearson](https://www.pearson.com/). It covers principles like Planning, Organizing, Leading,
    and Controlling. The assignment of the course was about an analysis on a company (which my group
    has chosen Tesla) and final assessment was a take home exam with several essay questions.

    Overall, I think this subject is rather interesting and provides good contents. However, 
    I feel like this subject doesn't fit well into my computer science course. I definitely wonder
    why Management instead of other essential subjects like Linear Algebra or Calculus.

- ### Digital Thinking and Innovation

    This subject introduced me about several technological terms like Internet of Things (IoT), Agile,
    and more. The assignment for the subject was creating a solution to an existing issue in any of the
    medical domains.

    Well, frankly speaking, I don't feel like this subject is necessary on its own. This is because
    the terms will be covered and taught more properly in other subjects. For example, Machine Learning
    would be taught in Introduction to AI subject. Again, from my opinion, it would be better if 
    another programming or mathematical subject would be better than this.

- ### Introduction to Networking

    As the name suggested, this subject taught everything about the basics of networking, from IP to MAC
    to routers and more. This subject was tied closely to Cisco's [textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Networks-Companion-Guide-CCNAv7/dp/0136633668) 
    and [courses](https://www.netacad.com/courses/networking/ccna-introduction-networks).
    The final assignment was regarding building a complete network for two sites.

    I personally enjoyed this subject a lot. It taught me many important concepts that I still use
    until now. Furthermore, upon completion, I could even get a certificate from Cisco for free!

- ### Operating System and Computer Architecture

    I've learned a lot of concepts about computer, operating system and many low level processes from
    this subject. The textbook I referred to was [The Architecture of Computer...](https://www.amazon.com/Architecture-Computer-Hardware-Software-Networking/dp/1118322630) (title too long).
    We had to analyze a hardware model and write a report about it (My group has chosen one of the
    first personal computers, [IBM 5150](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer)).

    Despite the subject being a bit dense and slightly boring, I do enjoy this subject very much as well.
    Nevertheless, the textbook was the most boring textbook I've ever read, like totally black and white
    with little details. Besides, I also enjoyed doing the assignment as my part (software) was quite
    interesting.

### Summary

My first year was neither good nor bad, it was a mix of good subjects and so-so subjects. Nevertheless,
most importantly, I've learned something new from this semester and to me, it is sufficient. Finally,
I managed to get a decent 4.0 for this semester.

Beside those subjects, I was also required to take Hubungan Etnik (Ethnic Relationship) as a supplementary
subject (Malaysia's requirement). Not much comment for this subject, basically just a subject about history.

## Semester 2

At the start of semester 2, I decided to take the career track [Data Scientist with R](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-r?version=5) from [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).
As a result, I kinda slacked off a bit during this semester and didn't focus as much in the assignment and exam.

- ### Introduction to C Programming

    The second programming subject, mainly about various concepts in C. Beside the basics, there were 
    structs, enums (union wasn't taught), pointers and linked list. Nevertheless, like Python Programming,
    extra libraries weren't taught much. The assignment for the subject was about building a 
    vaccine management system.

    Like Python Programming last semester, I've had some experience in C prior to this subject. Nevertheless,
    I did feel more confident in using some concepts like pointers and memory. However, flowcharts and 
    pseudocodes were included again in the assignment. I don't really understand why would my university
    care about both of those.

- ### System Analysis and Design

    This was mainly an analysis subject focusing on planning and analyzing. Through this subject, I was 
    exposed to several methods like waterfall, agile and software development life cycle. The assignment
    for this subject was going through a software development cycle, from planning up to design phase.

    Let's just say that I'm not very fascinated by this subject. I didn't even like it! However, one
    fact that I can't deny is that whatever I got from this subject are very practical. This became true
    especially when teaming up with people to undertake a project.

- ### Introduction to Artifical Intelligence

    This was a rather interesting subject. It taught about some terminologies and basics about artificial
    intelligence like searching algorithms, machine learning and Prolog. The assignment for this subject
    was building a chatbot.

    Though sounded interesting, I felt quite disappointed as well. There was no real programming involved
    in this subject (except some fundamental stuffs in Prolog). Besides, the lecturer expected the student 
    to use some online chatbot tools like [chatfuel](https://chatfuel.com/) which I'm not really into. 
    Therefore, as a rebellious student, my group used Python to build the chatbot. Other than that, I've
    actually learned some of the syllabus through [CS50AI](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/). Nevertheless,
    I guess overall this subject is rather decent on its own.

- ### Mathematical Concepts for Computing

    This was a very basic mathematics subject covering some number bases, proofs, and some maps.
    The best thing about it was that there wasn't any assignment for this subject.

    This subject was rather disappointing to me. I expected calculus or linear algebra but what I got was 
    some basic discrete mathematics stuffs that I learned quite some of it from high school
    or A levels.

- ### Introduction to Database

    On the other hand, this subject is more practical. This subject taught about the usage of SQL and 
    databases. The final assignment was about building a database for an airline system.

    Unluckily for me, I have studied SQL before and this subject did not even teach beyond what I already
    knew. Nevertheless, content wise, this subject is very practical and will be useful regardless
    of the domains in computer science. 

### Summary

The second semester feels less informative to me than the first semester. Many of the contents 
overlapped with what I have already learned prior to this semester. However, the assignments
and materials weren't as heavy as the first semester, so I had enough time to learn R on my own.

Like first semester, there was a Malaysian subject called Islamic Civilization. Besides, in this
semester, the students were required to hold an event. It wasn't very interesting for me, however,
because the event was held online.

## Conclusion

I definitely have a mixed feelings about this year. Some good and some bad. However, I believe
there's goods and bads in every university, and Asia Pacific University is one of them. After all,
when I graduate, what matters most is that my university is recognized locally as a technology
university. Furthermore, as there are many other CS students in my university, this would be 
beneficial to me as a part of my connections too.

### Best subject?

**Introduction to Networking** is my favourite so far, the only subject I really enjoy studying.

### Worst subject?

**Digital Thinking and Innovation**, I did not know the reason for this subject to be taught to us.
