## Which programming language to choose?
<img src="../assets/img/posts/how-to-start-programming/programming-languages.jpg" alt="programming languages" class="mx-auto">
This is often the first problem that stumbles most beginners as there are hundreds
if not thousands of programming languages out there. As for that, I propose two
ways that you can pick a programming language:

#### 1. Based on what your goal is
What do you want to do with programming? Making your own android app? A website?
Building a game? Different programming languages usually are better in some
of the fields than others. Therefore, if you have anything specific in mind,
you may consider following my list:

- **Creating a website**

To write a webpage, you must learn HTML and CSS at least. Then, you might want to
learn Javascript to add more functionalities to your webpage. For this, I
recommend starting with [Free Code Camp](freecodecamp.org/)'s 
[Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/).
Afterwards, you may want to learn Python if you want to build a fully functional
web application. This blog is made up of HTML, CSS and Javascript! (using jekyll)

- **Creating a computer/desktop application**

To make an application for your computer, either Java, C++ or C# will be fine.
I personally recommend learning C++. C++ may be very difficult at start, but as you
become more familiar with this language, you'll be able to learn other programming
languages very quickly. C++ is great because of its versatility, and easy to make
apps using its Qt framework.

Java is used a lot for many people are using it (popular because popular) and has 
a lot of documentation on it. If you're interested with Java instead, you can learn from
this book [Java: A Beginner's Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Beginners-Eighth-Herbert-Schildt/dp/1260440214), which I learned a lot from it. 
Meanwhile, C# is mainly for Windows application, I don't have much experience with it,
so yeah.

- **Analyzing data or Creating an AI**

Wants to make an AI chatbot? Wonders what is the [relationship between wealth and lifespan](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/15/being-wealthy-adds-nine-years-to-life-expectancy-says-study)? Python is the best option for 
you! I will be mentioning more about Python [below](#python).
