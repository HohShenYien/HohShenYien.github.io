## What is Linux?

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), Linux is an operating system (OS)
kernel created by [Linux Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds). What is a 
kernel then? You can think of a kernel to an OS is like brain to a human (The
appearance of an OS corresponds to your appearance).

Then where is the operating system? There are hundreds if not thousands of operating systems
(or what people refer to as distros) made using Linux kernel! Some of the most popular ones
are like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Elementary OS, and Manjaro Linux.

## Isn't Linux only for Computer Geeks?

Absolutely not! You can see in the picture above that it is almost identifcal to your
Windows (the taskbar can be moved to bottom to better resemble Windows). In fact, if you
use your computer mostly for web browsing, you won't even notice the difference! 

## So.... Why should I switch to Linux?

The followings are from my personal experience on using Linux, 

1. Faster, much faster!
    
    Due to the way Linux operates is different from Windows (like no automatic update during
    startup), Linux is a lot faster than Windows especially in terms of booting. It takes
    around 7 - 10 minutes for me to boot up my Windows, while it's less than 2 minutes for
    me to boot up Linux! (My laptop is a bit old, so slower startup). Other than that,
    opening an app in Linux is usually faster than Windows too.

2. Security
    
    If you were to be a hacker, looking at the above image, which OS will you hack?
    Clearly, because of larger markets, Windows and Mac OS will be primary target by them.
    Besides, as Linux kernel source codes are openly published, if there is any bug or 
    loophole, meny experienced programmers will solve them immediately! Thus, antivirus
    programs are often not needed by OS based on Linux. (This also saves your computer 
    resources like RAM and CPU)
    
3. Privacy

    I'm sure you have heard of how Microsoft/Apple collects your data and sells them elsewhere.
    It will never (almost never) happen in Linux-based OS! Not only that, the apps in Linux
    will usually not do so as well. If you're a person concerning of your privacy, you should
    definitely consider using Linux!

4. Free Apps

    Linux apps are mostly opensource. What does it mean? The apps are free to be used (and 
    modified, if you're a programmer like me) to everyone! and we all know, free is good.
