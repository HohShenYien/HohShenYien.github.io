I am a Malaysian who is enthusiastic in coding. I may be a small computer
geek, but unlike geeks in TV shows or legendaries who started coding since they were young,
I just started coding in 2019 ([My Programming Journey](./2021-07-04-my-programming-journey) if you're interested on how I started), when I was 18. 

## What about my life before programming?
### High School

Well, I was pretty much a normal student in high school. Nevertheless,
I do have some talents in Mathematics, though not a math genius, I'm just able to understand it slightly faster
than my peers. 

##### Anything significant about my high school life? 
- In the last 3 years of my high school (equivalent to grade 9 to 11), I got 2nd place in every exam, never raises, never drops.
- I was a prefect in high school.
- I did manage to get 10A+ (That's equivalent to be in top 10 percentile for all 10 subjects I taking) in SPM. Frankly speaking, obtaining 10A+ was one of my proudest moments in my life.
- I was kinda active in Wushu during high school, joining competitions twice a year
