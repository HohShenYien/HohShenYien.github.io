message: "Who are escort models? \r\nTo date, the escort industry has become very well-known and in demand. And this is logical, because thanks to such services, most wealthy men can significantly simplify their lives. \r\n \r\nDue to the fact that rich business men often have to attend important banquets, conversations and meetings, and according to etiquette they are supposed to come together with their couple, the escort sphere has become very popular. And escort models are ready to accompany their gentlemen at various banquets, meetings and other business events without any problems. Many people confuse this concept with prostitution, which is a big mistake. In order to more accurately understand the differences in these concepts, let's learn more about how escorts work. \r\n \r\nEscort models are beautiful ladies who accompany their client at various events, communicate with his entourage and increase his status in the eyes of society for financial reward. That is, these are trained girls with a pleasant and well-groomed appearance who portray the role of a wife, girlfriend or just a friend of their client. Working as an escort model, neither get a lot of money. But they invest most of their income in their appearance and self-development, because the more beautiful and interesting they are, the more clients they have and, accordingly, their income \r\n \r\nSometimes customers offer escort models to spend a vacation together or go on a business trip abroad, where girls also need to play a certain role, communicating with the client's environment. This form of cooperation allows girls to earn pretty good money without much effort. But for this it is necessary to prove yourself from the best side and have an ideal appearance. In addition, the escort model will need to fulfill the customer's requests, which are described in the contract for the provision of escort services. If you are energetic, sociable and beautiful, then it will not be difficult for you to grow to the level of a VIP model and increase your income several times [url=https://escort-euro.com/escorts]young escorts Madrid[/url] \r\n \r\nIn addition to a lot of money, a big advantage of working in escort services is having free time for yourself and your loved ones. After all, meetings with customers are mostly planned for the evening, and in your free time you can do whatever you want. Therefore, in the daytime you can do what you want and do your personal life.  And in the evening — to make a pleasant company to the client at various business events, communicating with his entourage. At the same time, you will be able to receive decent pay without much effort, and also get a chance to arrange your life the way you want. \r\n \r\nAre there any requirements for working as an escort? \r\nThe first thing an escort needs to have is a beautiful and well—groomed appearance. At the same time, it is not necessary to be an ideal, on the contrary, sometimes shortcomings significantly distinguish models from the rest of competitors. \r\n \r\nThe second requirement for escort models is activity, energy, and complaisant character. It is much easier for such models to work in the escort industry. \r\n \r\nWell, the third requirement is sociability. Sociable and energetic girls are always very popular. And knowledge of English will be a great bonus for employment."
