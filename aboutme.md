Hello there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Hoh Shen Yien. I'm an undergraduate student who is interested software development and machine learning. 

## Here are some facts about me:

<ul class="fa-ul facts" style="margin-top:20px;">
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-university fa-2x"></i>
        </span>
    I am currently studying Computer Science with specialism in Data Analytics at
    <a href="https://www.apu.edu.my/" target="_blank">Asia Pacific University</a> in Malaysia.</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap fa-lg"></i>
        </span>
    I had obtained 10A+ in SPM (high school final examination) and 3A* in A level.</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-code fa-lg"></i>
        </span>
    I enjoy writing codes and doing projects. Some of my best projects can be found <a href="projects">here</a>.</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher fa-lg"></i>
        </span>
    I have been working as a part time tutor either personally or teaching in a tuition center.</li>

## My Programming Skills

<ul class="fa-ul langs" style="margin-top:20px;">
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fab fa-python fa-4x"></i><b>Python</b>
        </span>
        <div class="progress">
  <div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" style="width: 75%;" aria-valuenow="25" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">Strong</div>
</div>
    Python is my favourite and the first programming language that I learned. Beside basic
    syntax, I've used various libraries including PyQT5, Numpy, Panda, Tensorflow and more
    to build projects before.</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fab fa-java fa-4x"></i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Java</b>
        </span>
        <div class="progress">
  <div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" style="width: 67%;" aria-valuenow="25" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">Strong</div>
</div>
    I have used Java in developing two Android apps before and in the process, I've gained a lot
    of experience in writing Java codes.</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><b style="font-size: 4em;">R</b>
        </span>
        <div class="progress">
  <div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" style="width: 60%;" aria-valuenow="25" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">Moderate</div>
</div>
    R is yet another language that I really love to use especially for data analysis and exploratiion. I haven't been able to do much in R, but I have completed the Data Scientist career track from Datacamp. I am able to use rather fluently ggplot2 and tidyverse packages.</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fab fa-cuttlefish fa-4x"></i><b>&nbsp;&C++</b>
        </span>
        <div class="progress">
  <div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" style="width: 60%;" aria-valuenow="25" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">Moderate</div>
</div>
    I haven't used C and C++ much. Nevertheless, I've built a desktop app with C++ using
    QT framework. Besides, I've also implemented multithreading in C before too.</li>
    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fab fa-html5 fa-2x"></i><i class="fab fa-css3-alt fa-2x"></i>
    <b>HTML &CSS</b>
        </span>
        <div class="progress">
  <div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" style="width: 50%;" aria-valuenow="25" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">Moderate</div>
</div>
    I can't really create a cool animation or some creative arts with HTML & CSS, but
    by relying on Bootstrap, I am able to create some cool webpages. I didn't really
    focus much on both of these languages as they're not my priorities, but as I program,
    both of these languages improve gradually along as well.</li>
</ul>

- Beside the ones mentioned above, I've also had some experience with javascirpt, Haskell, C# and Kotlin.
- I am also rather good with data structures and algorithms as I do [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems every now and then.
